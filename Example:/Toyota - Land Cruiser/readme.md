You can import a Land Cruiser into the United States if it's at least 25 years old. The vehicle is exempt from emissions standards if it has the original engine or an engine that's been previously certified by the EPA. 
You'll need to fill out all the EPA and DOT paperwork to clear the vehicle with the US Customs and Border Protection. 
Here are some things to consider when importing a diesel Land Cruiser: 
Left-hand-drive diesel Land Cruisers are very rare and difficult to acquire.
It's not economically possible to legally import newer 70 series and modify them to meet EPA and DOT standards.
Imported Land Cruisers will likely have high mileage and need more maintenance and work done.
Many imported vehicles are right-hand-drive (RHD). It's a myth that RHD vehicles are difficult to operate and drive in the US.
